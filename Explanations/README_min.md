### App Architecture:
The CodeBoard app follows a modular architecture, with clear separation of concerns. It consists of several packages, each responsible for specific functionalities:

1. **Activities and Fragments**: These components handle user interaction and UI presentation. They include `IntroActivity`, `MainActivity`, and `SettingsFragment`, among others.

2. **Layout Package**: This package contains classes related to the layout and rendering of the keyboard. It includes classes like `Box`, `Key`, `KeyboardButtonView`, `KeyboardLayoutView`, and `KeyboardUiFactory`.

3. **Theme Package**: This package manages the visual theme settings for the UI elements. It includes classes like `ThemeDefinitions`, `ThemeInfo`, and `UiTheme`.

4. **Notification Package**: Handles notifications and related functionalities. It includes the `NotificationReceiver` class.

### Data Flow:
The data flow in the app involves several components interacting with each other to handle user input and update the UI accordingly.

1. **User Input Handling**: When the user interacts with the keyboard, touch events are captured by the `KeyboardButtonView` class. These events trigger actions like key presses and releases.

2. **Keyboard Layout Generation**: The `Definitions` class in the layout package generates the keyboard layout based on predefined configurations. It constructs the layout by adding rows of keys, including arrow keys, copy-paste keys, and custom keys.

3. **Theme Management**: The `ThemeDefinitions` class in the theme package manages the themes available in the app. It provides predefined themes like Material Dark, Material White, etc., and allows switching between them.

4. **UI Rendering**: The `KeyboardLayoutView` class renders the keyboard layout on the screen. It uses the layout information provided by the `Definitions` class to position and display the keys. The appearance of the keys is determined by the current theme settings defined in the `UiTheme` class.

5. **User Settings**: The `SettingsFragment` class allows users to customize their keyboard settings, such as theme selection and layout preferences.

### Control Flow:
The control flow in the app is primarily driven by user interactions and system events:

1. **App Launch**: The `IntroActivity` class handles the initial app launch and provides an introduction screen to the user.

2. **Main Activity**: After the introduction, the `MainActivity` class becomes the main entry point of the app. It displays the keyboard layout and handles user input.

3. **Settings**: Users can access settings through the `SettingsFragment`, where they can customize the keyboard theme and layout preferences.

4. **Notifications**: The `NotificationReceiver` class handles notifications related to the keyboard, such as displaying notifications for caps lock and shift keys.
