The `Key` class is like a container for each key on the keyboard. It holds two main things: where the key is on the screen (`box`), and what the key does (`info`). This class is like a backbone for managing how keys look and work in the keyboard app.

Here's how it works:

```java
public class Key {
    // This part holds information about where the key is on the screen
    public Box box;
    
    // This part holds information about what the key does
    public KeyInfo info;
}
```

So, whenever you see a key on the keyboard, this class keeps track of its position and function. It's like the blueprint for making keys work properly in the keyboard app.
