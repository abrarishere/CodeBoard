Let's break down the `KeyboardLayoutView` class:

```java
public class KeyboardLayoutView extends ViewGroup {

    private final UiTheme uiTheme;

    public KeyboardLayoutView(Context context, UiTheme uiTheme) {
        super(context);
        setBackgroundColor(uiTheme.backgroundColor);
        this.uiTheme = uiTheme;
    }
```

Here, `KeyboardLayoutView` is a custom `ViewGroup` used to manage the layout of keyboard buttons. It sets the background color based on the provided UI theme and initializes the theme.

```java
@Override
protected void onMeasure(int widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec) {
    // Measure the view and its children
}
```

This method calculates the size of the keyboard layout based on the available screen dimensions and the specified portrait and landscape sizes in the UI theme.

```java
@Override
protected void onLayout(boolean changed, int l, int t, int r, int b) {
    // Position the child views within the layout
}
```

This method positions the child views (keyboard buttons) within the layout. It iterates through each child view and sets its position.

```java
public void applyShiftModifier(boolean shiftPressed){
    // Apply Shift modifier to all keyboard buttons
}

public void applyCtrlModifier(boolean ctrlPressed){
    // Apply Ctrl modifier to all keyboard buttons
}
```

These methods apply Shift or Ctrl modifiers to all keyboard buttons. They iterate through each child view (keyboard button) and apply the corresponding modifier.

```java
private Collection<KeyboardButtonView> getKeyboardButtons(){
    // Get all keyboard buttons in the layout
}
```

This method retrieves all keyboard buttons contained within the layout. It iterates through each child view and adds keyboard buttons to a collection, returning the collection afterwards.

Overall, `KeyboardLayoutView` serves as a container for arranging keyboard buttons and applying modifiers to them, ensuring consistent behavior and appearance across the keyboard layout.
